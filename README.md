# Motley-Fool-Subscription-Automation
This is a process automation project where I had to automate 3 different websites' processes at a time including Gmail. The goal of this project is to complete
the subscription process of The Motley Fool website after redeeming the discount coupon from the "Dollar Dig" website. This process there required some verification
with email. That's why I have to automate Gmail also.
